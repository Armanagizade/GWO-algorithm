# GWO-algorithm
I write GWO algorithm with python and MATLAB. I hope it will help you.
Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm based on how wolves search for prey in group . To emulate the internal leadership hierarchy of wolves, they are categorized into four types: alpha, beta, delta, and omega. In Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), the hunting (optimization) process is directed by the alpha, beta, and delta wolves. Essentially, this means the optimization process follows the trajectory of the top three solutions. Additionally, the prey represents the optimal solution of the optimization.
